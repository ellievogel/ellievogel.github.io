This week, I began working towards a certificate attesting to my abilities in quantum computing at Brookhaven National Laboratories. This course, put together by the Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage, is entitled Foundations of Quantum Computing. The course operates in Python, and has recently been covering data visualization, computational mathematics, and algorithmic efficiencies.

I also worked to solidify my project scope, researching CutQC, a platform that utilizes circuit cutting to achieve higher fidelities and speed for quantum algorithms given a certain qubit restraint. I am currently searching for ways to add to this code repository, and plan to utilize the computer architecture of both quantum and classical computers to improve this technology.

Each week, members of our lab participate in a quantum research paper discussion group. This week I dove into a recent release from Quantinuum entitled The Computational Power of Random Quantum Circuits in Arbitraty Geometries, which details the ability of their new H2 quantum computer to operate on up to 56 qubits with arbitrary connectivity and 99.843% two-qubit gate fidelity. I found this paper fascinating, and look forward to reading more releases in the upcoming weeks.
