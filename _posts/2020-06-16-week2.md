This week, I began working towards a certificate attesting to my abilities in quantum computing at Brookhaven National Laboratories. This course, put together by the Co-Design Center for Quantum Advantage, is entitled Foundations of Quantum Computing.

I also worked to solidify my project scope, researching CutQC, a platform that utilizes circuit cutting to achieve higher fidelities and speed for quantum algorithms given a certain qubit restraint. I am currently searching for ways to add to this code repository, and plan to utilize the computer architecture of both quantum and classical computers to improve this technology.

Our quantum research paper discussion group this week focuses on the development of SupermarQ, a quantum benchmarking suite developed to be both scalable and adaptable for various quantum applications.
