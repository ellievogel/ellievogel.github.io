title: Week 9
---

This week centered around poster creation. The data was collected, and graphs were generated to demonstrate our findings. We incorporated feedback from our mentor and finalized the poster. I was extremely happy with how our 2-page paper (limited by conference requirements) turned out. I have previously taken an academic writing class, and felt as though given the limitations in terms of space it turned out very well.

I also went back to completing more programming. Recently, I have been trying to clean up the codebase and make it more easily extendable in the future should someone want to build on my work. In order to do this, I created a general class for the "graph contractor" objects, which reconstruct the output probabilities. I then edited the codebase to make sure that both my version and the original version inherit from this class.
