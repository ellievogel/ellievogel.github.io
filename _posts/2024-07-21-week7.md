This week was focused on writing our paper, Accelerated Quantum Subcircuit Reconstruction Utilizing Multi-Node Computation. I also worked on preparing the additional requirements for submitting our paper for review to the International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering. We hope to be accepted into this conference, and to travel to Montreal in the fall to present.

I was also able to attend the talk Side Channel Attacks: Lessons Learned or Troubles Ahead? by Daniel Genkin from the School of Cybersecurity and Privacy at Georgia Tech.
Dr. Genkin's talk on  was extremely enjoyable to listen to and I feel like I learned a lot.

I also continued to develop working on my python scripts for collecting data and running SLURM scripts. I made sure that all of the python and SLURM scripts used to submit jobs to Adroit were functioning properly, and they were able to be run this week.
