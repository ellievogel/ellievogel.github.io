title: Week 5

This week, I began running tests on Princeton's Adroit and Della clusters. To collect control data for our project, I ran CutQC on one node, with up to 64 cores to experiment with the initial multithreading capabilities present in the code repository.

This week did not have a paper reading group, and was shortened due to the Fourth of July holliday.
