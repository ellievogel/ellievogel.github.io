# Undergraduate Research Experience Website: Summer 2024

## Project Description

This summer, I am working on CutQC: an open source code repository for quantum circuit cutting. The current code repository utilizes a single-node, multi-threaded implementation for the classical post-processing step. In my work, we enhance the reconstruction process. We contribute to CutQC a multi-node, single-threaded implementation of the classical post-processing step, as well as a multi-GPU implementation, utilizing PyTorch. We execute circuits of up to 35 qubits on 10- and 15- qubit QCs, and examine the reconstruction runtime. We utilize single-node, multi-threaded computation as a baseline, and then compare the results to the runtimes of our contributed workflows.

## Blog Posts

Each week, I detail my progress in a short blog post. This blog serves to detail the research papers I have read, the code that I have written, and the individual project goals I achieved while executing my project in a series of well-defined steps.

## Final Report

Expected release date: August 2024. This report will present my findings, demonstrate resulting code, and reflect upon my research experiences.
