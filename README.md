## Blog Posts

Each week, I detail my progress in a short blog post. This blog serves to detail the research papers I have read, the code that I have written, and the individual project goals I achieved while executing my project in a series of well-defined steps.

## Final Report

Expected release date: August 2024. This report will present my findings, demonstrate resulting code, and reflect upon my research experiences.
