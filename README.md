# Undergraduate Research Experience Website: Summer 2024

## Project Description

CutQC is an open source repository for the cutting of large quantum circuits into smaller subcircuits. It utilizes classical reconstruction techniques to evaluate the output of quantum circuits too large to fit on todays quantum computers with reasonable fidelity. My project this summer is to contribute to this code repository by utilizing both multi-node and multi-GPU implementations to improve the classical reconstruction step in its speed and size constraints. To do this, I will utilize NVIDIA's parallel computing platform CUDA, as well as Princeton University's research computing clusters.

## Blog Posts

Each week, I detail my progress in a short blog post. This blog serves to detail the research papers I have read, the code that I have written, and the individual project goals I achieved while executing my project in a series of well-defined steps.

## Final Report

Expected release date: August 2024. This report will present my findings, demonstrate resulting code, and reflect upon my research experiences.
